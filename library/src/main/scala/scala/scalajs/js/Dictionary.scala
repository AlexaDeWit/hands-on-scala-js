/** Dictionary "view" of a JavaScript value.
 *
 *  Using objects as dictionaries (maps from strings to values) through their
 *  properties is a common idiom in JavaScript. This trait lets you treat an
 *  object as such a dictionary.
 *
 *  To use it, cast your object, say `x`, into a [[Dictionary]] using
 *  {{{
 *  val xDict = x.asInstanceOf[js.Dictionary[Int]]
 *  }}}
 *  then use it as
 *  {{{
 *  xDict("prop") = 5
 *  println(xDict("prop")) // displays 5
 *  xDict.delete("prop")   // removes the property "prop"
 *  println(xDict("prop")) // displays undefined
 *  }}}
 *
 *  To enumerate all the keys of a dictionary, use [[js.Object.keys]], which
 *  returns a [[js.Array]] of the properties. It can be used in a for
 *  comprehension like this:
 *  {{{
 *  for (prop <- js.Object.keys(xDict)) {
 *    val value = xDict(prop)
 *    println(prop + " -> " + value)
 *  }
 *  }}}
